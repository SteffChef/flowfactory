Case Study 52: BNY Mellon – AI-Powered Contract Automation with Evisort	Originally, with each new custodial agreement, BNY Mellon tasked a team of lawyers to manually create a new contract based on approved, standardized agreement language and navigate a complex web of internal approvals and escalations. Contracts were sent by email through the approval process, with each lawyer individually reviewing prior changes, making new updates and emailing the updated contract to the next reviewer. This legacy process repeated itself until the agreement was finalized but came with a potential for gaps in accountability, version control and progress tracking. As a contract was finally executed, multiple review and summary forms then had to be compiled about the details of the agreement. This created additional time to the process contracts to ensure all documentation and compliance was completed. This led to prolonged onboarding periods for the client, resulting in increased costs.	BNY Mellon sought to automate the custodial agreement generation process to simplify stages of the review process with AI.

Case Study 68: Westpac – GenAI for Creditworthiness Assessment and Loan Assistance	LLMs can speed up banks' creditworthiness assessments by analyzing a wide range of complex information, including money transaction history, spending patterns, and social data. This enables a nuanced evaluation that gives lenders a clearer picture of risk while ensuring that borrowers with limited credit histories are considered more fairly.	Another use case for banking-specific LLMs is helping people fill out loan or mortgage forms. GenAI-based chatbots can guide borrowers through perplexing processes while bank workers can enjoy verified information and automated mortgage applications. The models dynamically adapt to new data, streamlining the lending process and reducing costs, leading to more comprehensive and accurate lending decisions.	Australia’s Westpac is working with Kasisto to test KAI-GPT, a bank-specific LLM designed to facilitate customer support and internal operations. Westpac will deploy KAI-GPT internally, primarily to support bankers, customer support agents, and mortgage officers. Initially, the AI will assist with mortgage applications, clarifying forms, and required information to speed up the lending process. KAI-GPT will also reduce errors by refining answers using industry-wide data and Westpac's proprietary information. This layered training approach ensures the system can draw on a broad range of banking knowledge while providing specific guidance based on Westpac's forms, policies, and documents.	Improved Creditworthiness Assessment: Broader and fairer evaluation of borrowers. Streamlined Loan Application: Faster and clearer mortgage process for customers. Error Reduction: Reduces mistakes in mortgage applications through better guidance. LLMs can increase decision accuracy by considering non-traditional data.

Westpac plans to expand KAI-GPT’s scope beyond mortgage support to assist in other banking services, such as customer service, financial planning, and fraud detection.
Case Study 69: BNY Mellon – Evisort AI-Powered Contract Automation	Originally, with each new custodial agreement, BNY Mellon tasked a team of lawyers to manually create a new contract based on approved, standardized agreement language and navigate a complex web of internal approvals and escalations. Contracts were sent by email through the approval process, with each lawyer individually reviewing prior changes, making new updates and emailing the updated contract to the next reviewer. This legacy process repeated itself until the agreement was finalized but came with a potential for gaps in accountability, version control and progress tracking. As a contract was finally executed, multiple review and summary forms then had to be compiled about the details of the agreement. This created additional time to the process contracts to ensure all documentation and compliance was completed. This led to prolonged onboarding periods for the client, resulting in increased costs.	BNY Mellon sought to automate the custodial agreement generation process to simplify stages of the review process with AI. We collaborated with Evisort, an AI company backed by Microsoft’s M12, that leverages ML and NLP to streamline contract generation, review and management. Evisort customized its artificial intelligence tools to review new custodial agreements based on BNY Mellon’s internal rules, guidelines, and processes. Evisort then used its AI technology to automatically create customized initial contracts and digitally coordinate with the necessary internal stakeholders for approval of special terms. Furthermore, Evisort's technology can automatically flag non-standard language and alert the necessary legal team members as well as automate the decision-making process, allowing attorneys to focus on more strategic tasks. For example, for all custody agreements, an attorney needs to fill out a detailed, multi-section worksheet to determine the most appropriate BNY Mellon legal entity to enter into a global custody or depositary agreement with a client. Evisort automates this decision-making process through a simple intake form.	Incorporating Evisort’s capabilities, BNY Mellon can now create, tailor, update and track contracts in a fraction of the time. In automating manual tasks, BNY Mellon is able to shorten and help streamline the onboarding process and effectively drive a better client end-experience. In leveraging AI, BNY Mellon will continue to improve contracting efficiency and establish the timely and appropriate escalation of deviations from standard contract language. The datatization of agreements additionally enables the bank to develop an instant "best first draft" that is tailored to each client, decreasing the amount of back and forth necessary in contract negotiations.	AI in Contracting: Automation of contract review and creation speeds up legal processes. Operational Efficiency: Reduces manual work, lowers costs, and improves client satisfaction. Data-Driven Decisions: Real-time data from contracts enhances compliance and monitoring.	BNY Mellon plans to leverage both NLP and ML to monitor risk exposure in contracts by using AI to identify nonstandard contract language, creating an alert system for ongoing obligations, unsigned contracts and/or upcoming renewal dates, as well as continuous monitoring of compliance as regulations change. In addition, AI will allow the bank to better understand common deviations and educate relationship managers on when those deviations are appropriate and the best course of action for proper mitigation.
